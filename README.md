# maze-solver
Solving a dynamic maze using reinforcement learning
Maze_solver file in old_code folder solve the static maze problem.
dynamic_maze_solver is the final version of the dynamic maze solver, can be found in the dynamic_maze file.
Remainder of files in old_code folder are older versions and other attempts.
Maze_solver_fire is an attempt at self-supervised learning but it did not do as well as dynamic_maze_solver nor did I see it solve.

Below is an image of the solution of the dynamic mazes optimal path. This was solved in 4157 steps during evaluation. npy file of Q table found in main directory. Images of the training found in addition.
